# NanaBox Sponsor Edition

NanaBox provides $99.99 Sponsor Edition addon to the Microsoft Store for attract
more sponsors and contributors.

It's free for NanaBox source code repository contributors.

## Feature

The only difference for NanaBox Sponsor Edition is showing "❤️ Appreciate for
your sponsorship ❤️" button instead of "☕ Sponsor NanaBox ☕" button in the
next stable version of NanaBox's toolbar like the Visual Studio administrator
mode.

## Purpose

Hope every NanaBox users happier than before. Here are some imagination
examples.

- Most users: We are happy with using a $99.99 product freely without feature 
  differences.
- Contributors: We want to show "❤️ Appreciate for your sponsorship ❤️" button
  to others. It's free because we are the contributors. Contribute it if you
  want to get that free.
- Sponsors: We can show "❤️ Appreciate for your sponsorship ❤️" button to others
  because we deserve that.
- The author of NanaBox, Kenji Mouri: Finally, NanaBox has the price. Nobody 
  will think this is a worthless product. Efforts from contributors and I should
  have a reference price even NanaBox is a fully free and open source project.
