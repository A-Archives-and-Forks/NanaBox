# NanaBox Sponsor Edition

NanaBox provides a $99.99 USD Sponsor Edition addon to the Microsoft Store to
attract more sponsors and contributors.

It's free for NanaBox source code repository contributors.

## Feature

The only difference for NanaBox Sponsor Edition is showing "Appreciate your
sponsorship" button instead of "Sponsor NanaBox" button in the next
stable version of NanaBox's toolbar like the Visual Studio administrator mode.

## Purpose

We hope every NanaBox user is happier than before. Here is why we offer a
sponsored version:

- Most users: We are happy with using a $99.99 product freely without feature 
  differences.
- Contributors: We want to show "Appreciate your sponsorship" button to
  others. It's free because we are the contributors. Contribute it if you want
  to get that free.
- Sponsors: You can show "Appreciate your sponsorship" button to others
  because sponsors deserve that.
- The author of NanaBox, Kenji Mouri: Finally, NanaBox has a price. Nobody will
  think this is a worthless product. Efforts from contributors and I should have
  value even NanaBox is a fully free and open source project.
